                                The operating system is the medium through which the user-level applications can
                                 be interfaced with the hardware of a computer. This section will look at the differences
                                  between the Windows OS and Ubuntu (a Linux based OS). 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Essential Elements of Operating Systems</h3>
                            <p>
                                An operating system is known for its <i>Convenience</i> (Its Ease-of-use), <i>Efficiency </i>
                                (How well does it exploits the hardware resources available) and its Ability to
                                 evolve (Its adaptability to the frequently changing hardware technology).
                                 <br><br>

                                An OS’s ability to evolve is arguably the most important feature of an OS. For OS to be
                                 upgraded every so often without the need to reprogram it completely or making changes
                                  where no change is required an OS must be:
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Modular, with clearly defined interfaces between the modules </li>
                                      <li>Well Documented </li>
                                  </ul><br>
                                      The need for detailed documentation arises from the fact that most stable OS’s have
                                      tens of millions of lines of code with more than one programmer working on it. The
                                      lack of proper documentation makes it extremely difficult to make changes and debug
                                      unforeseen problems in an OS.

                                Both Windows and Linux have a modular design where some part of the system core will 
                                reside in independent files, called modules, which can be added to the system at
                                 runtime. 

                                Ubuntu has a Monolithic kernel (Linux) where all services (Virtual File systems, 
                                device drivers etc.) and core functionalities (Memory allocation, Scheduling etc.) 
                                share the same space and therefore in Linux’s modular design, the modules are 
                                inserted to and runs from the same space that handles the core functionalities 
                                (i.e. Kernel Space).

                                Windows on the other and is based on Microkernel architecture where the core 
                                functionality is separated from system services and device drivers. Each module in 
                                such an architecture is an isolated process when run.
                                <br><br><br>
                                The user convenience provided by OS depends on:<br><br>

                                <ul>

                                <li>Program development services (e.g. editors & Debuggers)</li>
                                <li>Program Execution (Fetching Instructions and Data from the memory, Carrying out the Instructions in Scheduled order etc.)</li>
                                <li>Access to I/O devices (Recognising the type of I/O device, running the appropriate device driver etc.).</li>
                                <li>Controlled access to Files (Reflecting on ‘the type of I/O devices to store and read data from’ as well as ‘the structure of the data’ the OS must provide access to the files)</li>
                                <li>System Access (The access to the system files must be secured and conflicts on resource contention must be resolved by the OS, especially in case of share systems)</li>
                                <li>Error Detections (Different kinds of errors occurring in the system must be detected and resolved by the OS with assigned priority)</li>
                                <li>Accounting (The OS must register the systems performance statistics which can be used in determining future enhancements and managing processing power provided to overtaxing components).</li>
                                </ul>

                                Linux based distros have made huge leaps over the years, so both Ubuntu and Windows
                                 are good in ‘Ease-Of-Use-Field’. However, Windows, due to market proliferation, is
                                  the default OS on many devices and hence most single-platform software developers
                                   chose Windows over Linux as their target platform. 

                                <br><br>
                                OS Evoltution over the years has gone from:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>	Serial Processing (Directly interfacing the hardware) to -- </li>
                                    <li>	Simple Batch Systems (Relying on the monitor software that schedules and assigns different jobs to the processor.) to --</li>
                                    <li>	Multiporgrammed Batch systems (With an upgraded monitor software that can run multiple jobs at
                                         the same time if the different hardware resources are needed by the qued jobs)</li>
                                    <li>	Time Sharing systems (A form of Multiprogrammed batch system where multiple-interactive-jobs can be run at ‘seemingly’ same time)</li>
                                </ul>

                                Multiprogrammed-Batch-Systems focus on maximizing processor use while Time-Sharing systems focus on minimizing response time.

                            <h3>Ethos for code development (Windows vs Ubuntu)</h3>
                            <p>
                                With the launching of the first personal computer by IBM, Microsoft developed the OS 
                                MS-DOS that ran on it. For Over a decade DOS was the underlying software for all 
                                Microsoft’s OSs, which was inefficient in exploiting the hardware resources available
                                 in the continuously upgrading technology. In 1993, windows developed a new OS from
                                  scratch (Windows NT), that could exploit the capabilities of the contemporary
                                   microprocessors and provided multitasking in both single and multi-user 
                                   environment.

                                Linux was created by a Finnish CS student, Linus Torvalds, as a variant for UNIX that 
                                ran on IBM PC (Intel 80386), posted on the internet in 1991. Linux was made available
                                 as an open source software under the endorsement of The Free-Software-Foundation
                                  (FSF), whose GNU project provided the tools used by Torvalds to develop Linux-Kernel.
                                Over the years, many programmers have collaborated in the development of 
                                Linux making it full-featured UNIX system that runs on most platforms. <br><br>

                                In 2005, Torvalds created a distributed version-control system, GIT, to be used
                                 in software development for tracking any changes made in the source code. This
                                  boosted the Linux-Kernel development process, where thousands of developers are 
                                  making changes and adding to its source code. <br><br>

                                The source code for Ubuntu originates from an older Linux distro – Debian which had
                                 become less popular over the years because of infrequent updates. Created in 2004
                                  by the company Canonical Ltd. Funded by Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu has frequently
                                   topped the Linux distro charts.


                                Most Linux based distros (including Ubuntu) are available for free with their source
                                 code available on the internet (Changes subjected to Open GPL License) whereas
                                  Windows Operating systems are commercial software and have to be paid for.

                            <h3>The GNU Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                The GNU project, GNU being a recursive acronym for ‘GNU’s Not Unix’, was started by
                                 Richard Stallman. The project supports the idea of free software where the term
                                  ‘free’ comes from ‘Freedom’ and not necessarily from the ‘Price’ of a software. <br><br>

                                A program is considered free :-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>	If it can be run for any purpose by the user </li>
                                    <li>	The user has the freedom to modify the program to suit their need (i.e. Have access to the programs source code)</li>

                                Stallman, realising the first step to an open-source community was having a free 
                                Operating System, developed the GNU operating system. Over the years he added the
                                 Emacs text editor and GCC compiler to the OS. By 1990 GNU was almost complete but 
                                 it was still missing a Kernel and so ‘GNU Hurd’ was created which was GNU running 
                                 on the microkernel Mach (Developed at Carnegie and Utah University). The GNU Hurd,
                                  however, was not suitable for production use and so, in 1992, when Linux was made
                                   free, GNU/Linux (GNU system running on Linux Kernel) was created.   

                                Arising issues like, ‘propriety’ companies modifying the ‘free’ software and making
                                 them part of their ‘nondisclosure’ propriety software, called for the need of a licence. 
                                The GNU GPL licence was therefore created which was a ‘copyleft’ license
                                 (i.e. having the opposite effect of copyright and keeping a program free
                                  instead of restricting its use) subjecting any program that is created by
                                   either modifying or combining with another program written under the GPL 
                                   to be subjected to the GPL itself. <br><br>
